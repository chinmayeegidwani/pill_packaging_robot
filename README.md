# pill_packaging_robot
This project contains the PIC18 and Arduino microcontroller code for a robot that autonomously dispenses up to 40 pills into medicine boxes according to user specification. My teammates Katie and Eric are to thank for the circuits and electromechanical components, as well as the CAD drawings below :)

The robot takes inputs in the form of potential user information, such as repetition, frequency, and specific days of the week that pills are required. There are three types of pills, modeled by "flat", "round" and "long" shapes. The robot will dispense these pills into the appropriate slots in a medicine box. For example, a user may require round pills on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in the afternoon. These pills will be dispensed into the medicine box slot corresponding to these times.
